Is a one-click purchase solution for e-commerce business who want to reduce friction in their checkout experience, reducing consumer’s decision time. 

The average cart abandonment rate across different industries equalled 88% in 2020. But with the average across cart solutions of:
•	Between 4 and 8 clicks
•	Between 13 and 16 fields

The longer and complicated you checkout process is, the more customers you loose. Instant is the best solution for retailers looking to reduce cart abandonment.
Given the platform nature of Instant, it has the added value that the business can leverage the network effects now being able to sell in 1 click to new customers already using Instant rather than having to make them sign in that first time.
